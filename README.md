# Dotfiles

Dotfiles for configuring my development environment.

## Installation

To use these dotfiles, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/adithyakb10/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Change into the dotfiles directory.

   ```shell
   cd dotfiles
   ```

3. Run the installation script.

   ```shell
   chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
   ```

   The installation script will create symbolic links to the dotfiles in your home directory, replacing any existing files with the same names and will install necessary dependencies

## Usage
